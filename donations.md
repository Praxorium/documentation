Praxorium was launched in 2019 as an experiment in creating and holding a space -- an ecosystem -- for harnessing collective intelligence to actively work on managing wicked social challenges. If (and when!) the experiment proves successful in terms of attracting sufficient community engagement and financial donations to assure Praxorium's ongoing viability and development, Praxorium will be formally constituted as a not-for-profit organisation. 

In the meantime, all costs of the Praxorium project will be covered by the founder. If you would like to support the project and help ensure its continuance, donations will be gratefully received via the founder's personal Patreon page [link].

Regardless of source, amount or timing, donations to Praxorium will always be treated as non-refundable gifts with no strings attached, and reported openly and transparently. This approach to funding is critical to enable Praxorium to maintain as clear a separation as possible from existing institutions, biases, habits and assumptions, and focus fully on developing and tending the Praxorium ecosystem. 

In practice, a "non-refundable gift with no strings attached" means that Praxorium does not in any case agree to work towards particular outcomes, render any services, or privilege any line of inquiry or interest. All participation in the Praxorium ecosystem is strictly voluntary.
