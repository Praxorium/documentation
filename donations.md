Praxorium has been launched in 2019 by Kylie Stedman Gomes as an experiment, and is therefore being managed as a hobby until it has proven sustainable enough to warrant setting up a not-for-profit organisation.

During the experimental period, donations will therefore be accepted via Kylie's personal Patreon page. Because Kylie offers consulting as a gift as well as stewarding the Praxorium community, it would be wonderful if donations were accompanied by a small statement regarding which initiative the donation is intended to support.

It is envisaged that Praxorium as a not-for-profit organisation -- in future! -- will accept donations directly via the Praxorium website, and that ultimately projects under the Praxorium umbrella will also be able to accept donations via the Praxorium donation management system.

Regardless of source or timing, donations to Praxorium will always be treated as no-strings-attached, accepted not in return for services or under any agreement to achieve particular outcomes, but rather, accepted as gifts towards the continued growth and wellbeing of the Praxorium ecosystem and its efforts to promote better understanding and management of humanity's wicked challenges.
